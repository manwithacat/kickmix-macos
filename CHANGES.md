# Changes

## Vendored upstream

- UPSTREAM_COMMIT: `638777fac4379bc62e2a1e4a52cf1a1753895d48` (quantumlib/Qualtran `main`,
  2026-10-22, "Add ci action to build kickmix wheels (#1982)"). Directory `kickmix/`
  is a verbatim copy of that commit's `kickmix/` directory plus the overlay below.

## Overlay (patches/neon-simd.patch)

- 2026-10-25: NEON word types `b128_neon` and `b256_neon` for AArch64; dispatch in
  `simd.h` with a `KICKMIX_DISABLE_NEON` opt-out; test and benchmark macro
  instantiations; perf goal entries. Validated: upstream Python suite (3,403 tests)
  passes; simulation output identical to the portable build; the three Kaggle
  "Verifiable Quantum Circuit Compilation" official verifiers reproduce their
  hosted results to the digit on Apple Silicon.
